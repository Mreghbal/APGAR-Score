# APGAR-Score
Here's a Python code for calculating the APGAR score, including all parameters in actual condition
In this code, the calculate_apgar_score function takes five parameters: appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration. It calculates the APGAR score based on the provided inputs. The APGAR score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating better overall condition.

After defining the function, the code prompts the user to enter the values for each parameter. It then calls the calculate_apgar_score function with the provided inputs and stores the result in the apg_score variable. Finally, it displays the calculated APGAR score to the user.
