## Introduction
Welcome to the APGAR Score Calculator repository! This Python code calculates the APGAR score, which is a quick assessment tool used to evaluate the overall condition of newborn babies. The APGAR score helps healthcare professionals determine if immediate medical intervention is required.

## What is the APGAR Score?
The APGAR score is a scoring system developed by Dr. Virginia Apgar in 1952. stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration. Each parameter is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 2, with a maximum total score of 10. The higher the score, the better the baby's condition.

The five parameters are assessed at one minute and five minutes after birth. The scores for each parameter are then added together obtain the final APGAR score. The evaluation provides a snapshot of the baby's vital signs and helps healthcare providers make decisions regarding immediate care.

## Applications
The APGAR score is widely used in delivery rooms and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to assess the newborn's health and determine if any interventions are necessary. It provides a standardized and objective measure of the baby's condition, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly identify infants who may require additional support or medical attention.

Some common applications of the APGAR score include:
- Identifying babies who may need resuscitation or immediate medical intervention.
- Monitoring the baby's response to resitation efforts.
- Assessing the effectiveness of interventions during the first few minutes after birth.
- Comparing the condition of newborns over time to track their progress.

## Getting Started
To use the APGAR Score Calculator, follow the steps below:

 Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.0 or higher) installed on your machine.

### Installation
